      question: 'What is a blockchain certificate?',
      answer: 'It\'s a digital academic credential represented as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on a blockchain. This gives it a unique, verifiable, and tamper-proof identity, unlike a traditional PDF or paper certificate.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How is this more secure than traditional methods?',
      answer: 'Traditional certificates can be easily forged. Blockchain records are immutable, meaning once a certificate is issued (minted), it cannot be changed or deleted. Its authenticity can be mathematically proven by anyone at any time.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Where is the actual certificate file stored?',
      answer: 'The NFT on the blockchain holds the proof of authenticity and a unique link. The actual certificate file (e.g., a PDF or image) is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), a decentralized storage network that ensures the file is always available and cannot be secretly altered.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What do I need to receive and view my credential?',
      answer: 'All you need is a standard digital wallet (like MetaMask). This wallet acts as your secure portfolio to hold and manage your NFT credentials. Our platform makes it easy to view and share them.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the system scalable for large institutions?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. EduCred is built to scale across large universities and massive online course platforms. Our smart contracts are optimized for efficient batch minting of thousands of credentials at once.'
